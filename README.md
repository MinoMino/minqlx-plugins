# minqlx-plugins
This is a collection of plugins for [minqlx](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx).
The Python dependencies are included in requirements.txt. Make sure you do a
`python3.5 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` first. `pyzmq` and `hiredis` might
need `easy_install` instead of `pip`.

The extras directory contains plugins I would not advice you use unless you further improve them or
just use them for the purpose of learning.

This repository only contains plugins maintained by me. Take a look [here](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx/wiki/Useful-Plugins) some of the plugins by other users that could be useful to you.

If you have any questions, the IRC channel for the old bot,
[#minqlbot on Quakenet](http://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=minqlbot),
is being used for this one as well. Feel free to drop by.

## Plugins
This is a list of plugins and their cvars. Set the cvars by passing them as a command line argument or using `server.cfg`

  voted yes.
    - Default: `1`
  - `qlx_votepassThreshold`: If `qlx_votepass` is `1`, determines the percentage (in decimal) of in-game players required to
  vote before it automatically passes any votes.
    - Default: `0.33`
  - `qlx_teamsizeMinimum`: The minimum teamsize allowed to vote for. `!teamsize` can override this.
